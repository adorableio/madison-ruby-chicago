    <h2>CODE OF CONDUCT</h2>
    <p>Madison+ Ruby is a community conference intended for networking and
    collaboration in the developer community.</p>
    <p>We value the participation of each
    member of the Ruby community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and
    fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect
    and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference
    events, whether officially sponsored by Madison+ Ruby or not.</p>
    <p>To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at any Madison+
    Ruby event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers
    will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>
    <h3>THE SHORT VERSION</h3>
    <p>Madison+ Ruby is
    dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone,
    regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
    size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
    participants in any form.</p>
    <p>All communication should be appropriate for a
    professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual
    language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including
    talks.</p>
    <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
    professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
    jokes are not appropriate for Madison+ Ruby.</p>
    <p>Attendees violating these rules may
    be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the
    conference organizers.</p>
     <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly
    event for all.</p>
    <h3>THE LONGER VERSION</h3>
    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments
    related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
    size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
    stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
    talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
    attention</p>
    <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
    comply immediately.</p>
    <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or
    similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
    particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other
    material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized
    clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
    <p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other
    exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and
    offensive jokes are not appropriate for Madison+ Ruby.</p>
    <p>If a participant engages
    in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the conference organizers may
    take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
    expulsion from the conference with no refund.<p>
