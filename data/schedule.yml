      description: 'This talk explores linguistic theory and how it relates to
      a model of human thought based around spoken language.Inspired in part by
      recent writing by Douglas Hofstadter, I make the case that the core
      mechanism of our thinking relates very closely to our ability to make
      metaphors and categorize experiences. I connect these two concepts to make
      the case that with a broader vocabulary of metaphors, we can become better
      problem solvers. Oh, and I dip into category theory a bit as well. :)'

      Retention and training is much cheaper than hiring and on-boarding and
      leads to a better work place. We think we have a lightweight structure
      for supporting developer growth and we think it will be effective for a
      variety of small developer teams.
      All it takes is three people, some sharpies, and some sticky notes...'

      Formal specification & model-checking (e.g. TLA+),
      Types&#39; slogan: "Make Illegal States Unrepresentable",
      More formal methods: (e.g. proving stuff)

      Yes, this is a _ton_ of stuff and it&#39;s going to be pretty technical. I&#39;m
      also going to go through things quickly and info-dump. There will be
      copious breadcrumbs leading you to where you can go to learn more. This
      is a horizon-expanding "what&#39;s out there" sort of talk.

      Now that I&#39;ve (convinced you/scared you off), it&#39;ll also be lots fun;
      learning new stuff always is. I&#39;m going to make this stuff approachable
      from the point of view of someone who&#39;s got some testing under their belt.
      We can always tie things back to "how can I make my code better?" Put on

      approach to crafting is the same as coding. You wouldn&#39;t believe how
      similar writing a crochet pattern is to writing code. There are hardware
      requirements, different languages, loops, methods, and modeling diagrams.

      In this talk, I&#39;ll show how reading and writing crochet patterns uses
      many of the same fundamental principles as coding, complete with Ruby code
      samples and personal crochet samples. You will walk away thinking about
      coding principles and their applications beyond your screen. You might
      even become interested in learning to crochet!'

      something we need to be conscious of and work to improve our efforts to
      address it effectively.
      2) The Color Wheel and Dangerous Color Combos
      How to evaluate and avoid tricky color combinations, and how to make
      better color pairing decisions.
      3) Typography, Text, and Legibility
      How color, contrast, and size can impact a user&#39;s ability to read text.
      4) UX Patterns
      Which UI trends lend themselves to accessibility, and strategies for
      successfully adapting those that do not.
      5) Links, Buttons, and Forms
      Strategies for making these utilitarian elements more usable for everyone.
      Conclusion
      Making choices that increase visual accessibility ultimately increase how
      usable our work and the web is for everyone.'

      experiences and educational history.
      As a journalist-bartender-turned-developer, I&#39;m constantly finding ways
      that my “useless” liberal arts background and years spent slinging pints
      of beer have, in fact, prepared me for a successful career in tech. For
